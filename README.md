The state of unhappiness among the country’s youth confirms the findings of a recent survey conducted by the Regional Social and Cultural Studies Programme at the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute that Indonesian youth tend to be the most pessimistic in Southeast Asia. 

The survey shows that they are frustrated with the country’s unfavourable socio-economic and political conditions.
One of the areas the survey covered was youth satisfaction with the political system and a country’s economic outlook. For this, Indonesian youth were the most pessimistic. 

Indonesian youth exhibited the highest levels of dissatisfaction with their political system compared to their Southeast Asian counterparts. In the survey, 71.5 per cent of respondents expressed dissatisfaction, with only 27.0 per cent stating they were satisfied.

By contrast, the ISEAS survey also revealed that 63.9 per cent of Indonesian youth agreed to taxing the rich to help the economically disadvantaged – the highest compared to other Southeast Asian countries. 

Economic hardship was a critical factor which shaped youth pessimism. The survey indicates that 37.8 per cent of Indonesian youth perceive their national economy to be “bad”, and only 2.6 per cent believe it to be “very good”.

Furthermore, only 62.6 per cent of Indonesian respondents strongly agreed or agreed that the country’s economic outlook over the next five years is promising, significantly lower than other Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam (88.1 per cent) or Malaysia (84.1 per cent).
